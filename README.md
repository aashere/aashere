### üëã About Me

Hi, I'm Ameya! I study computer science at New York University, focusing my coursework in data science, statistics, and machine learning. I am skilled at leveraging my technical background to dissect complex business problems and develop creative solutions that consistently exceed stakeholder expectations. I am currently seeking a data or machine learning role starting in January 2023. 

My main languages are Python and SQL, though I have experience with many different languages and frameworks. I have worked closely with all aspects of the data science lifecycle - EDA, ETL, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and data visualization. I also have a rigorous mathematical foundation in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and multivariate calculus, which has given me a deep understanding of the tools I use.

I have had two internship experiences, one in software engineering, and another in data science. Through these experiences, I have developed strong collaboration skills, and I am adept at problem framing and communication with both technical and non-technical business leaders.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, singing, and cooking.

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Internship
During my most recent internship with [Intuitive](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us), I:

Collaborated with a team to set up a series of digital product lift analyses with organization-wide impact
  - Architected and implemented 2 modular, performance-efficient data foundation components using dbt SQL, prioritizing ease of access for downstream data consumers
  - Categorized data items into experimental groups by using Python to discover clusters in sequence data
  - Built a Python module from scratch to customize clustering for various data features and parameter settings
  - Delivered a final presentation to technical and non-technical senior leaders, including a Scientific Medical Officer and an SVP

Worked with another intern to build a supervised data quality outlier detection model on top of a Snowflake data warehouse
  - Arranged meetings with domain experts to identify candidate datasets and gain context about use cases
  - Performed exploratory data analysis, ETL, and feature engineering using Python
  - Identified bottlenecks and achieved a 5x speedup by writing SQL to offload ETL work from Python to Snowflake
  - Presented final results to key project stakeholders, directly linking the technical solution to business value

### üìä Projects
I have explored data science and machine learning through a number of projects. You can check these out here on GitHub:

### üìö Education

I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science (expected graduation January 2023) at NYU's [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). I have also earned my B.A. in Computer Science from NYU, [College of Arts and Science](https://cas.nyu.edu/). In recognition of my undergraduate academic achievements, I have been elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and I graduated with magna cum laude latin honors.
